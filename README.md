# damaged_car_classification
Here is a simple car damaged classification project. The training has been done by using the inceptionV3 pretrained model. By the end of this training, the system is able to differentiate a damaged car from a non damaged car. This work is a starting point for traffic monitoring or/and for insurance companies to classify damaged car sent by their customers.
Training on 20 epochs, the training accuracy is 93.10% with 91.96% as validation accuracy.
